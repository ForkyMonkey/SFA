Programm, which can be used for static analyze any type of digital files using sliding window method
The sliding window method is a technique commonly used in binary analysis of digital files. This method involves dividing the file into smaller sections, called windows, and analyzing each window separately.

The size of the window is typically fixed, and the window is moved over the file in a sliding manner, one window at a time. The analysis of each window can involve various techniques, such as searching for specific patterns or signatures, extracting metadata, or performing statistical analysis.

The sliding window method is often used in malware analysis, where it allows for the detection of hidden or obfuscated code, as well as in forensic analysis, where it enables the identification of specific file structures or anomalies. The choice of window size depends on the specific analysis requirements, as larger windows can provide more context but may also increase the computational complexity of the analysis.
